    <p>Pasta is traditional dish from Italy - well, at least I think
        It is. I'm not entirely sure on that, but I do know it is delicious!
        Check out how to cook pasta below!
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Choose your type of pasta.</b> Examples include:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rigatoni</li>
            <li>Angel Hair <i>- used often for Spaghetti!</i></li>
            <li>Penne</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Water. Just water.</b></li>
        <li><b>Your favorite pot</b><i>- not the green kind. IYKYK!</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill your pot up with water and place it on a burner.</li>
        <li>Turn on the burner to high, and now wait for your water to boil. <i>PRO TIP: Salt your water! it adds flavor to the pasta!</i></li>
        <li>Once your water is boiling <i>(it should be bubbling)</i> pour in your pasta</li>
        <li>As your pasta boils, periodically check if it's past the point of "sticky." You don't want your pasta to be too sticky nor too soggy.</li>
        <li>After roughtly 10 minutes, you should be ready to eat your pasta! <i>PRO TIP: eat your pasta with red sauce or alfredo sauce to actually be able to enjoy it!</i></li>
    </ol>
    <h2> Important to note... </h2>
    <p>Your pasta should boil anywhere between 8-12 minutes. The time varies and is dependent on the pasta you are using.
        Anyways, enjoy your, uh, bland, plain pasta with no sauce...please tell me you used sauce...
