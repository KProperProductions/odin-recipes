    <img src="../img/pbjyummy.jpg" alt="Child Eating Peanut Butter">
    <p>Now <em>this is <strong>EPIC!</strong></em> IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY!
    The famous sandwich that ended racism between nuts and berries. It's a snack that you have from
    dusk til dawn, for lunch when you're in middle school through end of life. Let's learn how to make it!
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Peanut Butter.</b><i> Creamy or Crunchy to choose from!</i></li>
        <li><b>2 slices of Sliced Loaf Bread.</b><i> You can also do it the hard way by slicing your own bread. If you do this though, 
            be warned: you will be a pretentous jerk...</i></li>
        <li><b>Jelly (or "Jam")</b><i> Strawberry, Grape, Blueberry...it "verries"</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Procedure:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Place your 2 slices of bread horizontally mirrored (side-by-side long ways).</b> <em> Note: You can also placed them down vertically mirrored.</em>
        </li>
        <li><b>Take a butter knife and use it to scoop and spread Peanut butter on the left side sliced bread.</b></li>
        <li><b>Clean your knife. </b><em> do NOT forget this step!</em></li>
        <li><b>Take the same butter knife and use it to scoop and spread Jelly onto the right side sliced bread.</b> 
            <em> Can you guess why we cleaned the knife? 
                SO YOU DON'T UNWANTEDLY MIX YOUR PEANUT BUTTER INTO YOUR JELLY ONLY 
                JAR!
            </em>
        </li>
        <li><b>Finally, unite the sliced bread covered with peanut butter with the slice bread on the right.</b>
            <em> Note: Make sure that the sides with peanut butter and jelly combine. I made the mistake of screwing this step up, and it was very messy on me fingers...</em></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Bon Appetit!</h2>
