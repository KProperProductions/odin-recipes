Just some recipes for my Odin Fam. 

Hello! My name is Kyle, and this is my first Odin Project. 

The assignment is to create a main page with relative links leading to food recipes. These recipes can either be fictional or real, but because I cannot cook, I will likely just teach you how to make a good bowl of cereal, pasta, and maybe the perfect PB&J. 

This is project is to demonstrate the skills I have learned so far during my TOP curriculum. I will be utilizing GitHub to share my progress and save my project, developing HTML webpages using what I have learned so far on my journey, and uh, I think that's it. I'll also probably be practicing my commit messaging, which is pretty important. 

Wish me luck! If you stick around this long, please check out my first project!

Thank you.
